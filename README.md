# cyberrange

Building a Cloud Experience: The goal was to build a cyber laboratory in a cloud environment, and we used cloud platforms such as Oracle Cloud to configure and manage our infrastructure.

Utilizing Kubernetes and Dockers: I created and managed custom pods using dockers, a container technology, and Kubernetes, an orchestration tool. This allowed us to build a scalable infrastructure.

ELK Stack Implementation: Using Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana (ELK) stacks, we built an environment to collect and visualize diverse data. This enabled log management and analysis.

Implementation of a remote access environment: Using Apache Guacamole, we have configured an environment where multiple users can access remotely. This helped support collaboration and remote work with team members.

Migration: You performed a migration from an on-premise to a cloud environment. In this process, we handled server settings, network management, and cluster management.

Pod extension within limited resources: Added the ability to extend pods within limited resources to differentiate them from existing cyber experimental sites.

Security and network management: Experience in building infrastructure and addressing security challenges in cloud and on-premise environments.

Project Management and Collaboration: Improved collaboration and project management with team members.

Information Security Experience: Using the ELK stack, I learned how to manage and analyze logs and apply and understand information security. I gained experience in collecting and analyzing log data to detect and respond to security issues.

Continuous Learning and Passion: Continuous development in the field of information security, increased enthusiasm for applying the latest technologies and trends, and improved determination to continuously learning.
